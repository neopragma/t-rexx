# t.rexx

Unit testing framework for Rexx.

The test framework comprises three files: t1, t2, and t3. Each contains a piece of the test framework. The code works by concatenating thesse files with a test script and with the Rexx file to be tested, resulting in a single Rexx program. The order of concatenation is:

1. t1.rexx -> variables used by the test framework
1. the file containing the test script
1. t2.rexx -> boilerplate code that displays the results of the tests
1. the file containing the code to be tested
1. t3.rexx -> test framework functions

## Running tests with bash

The bash script ```runt``` performs the concatenation and executes the resulting file. For example, to run the 'calc' example provided in this repo, run ```runt``` as follows:

```shell
./runt calc-check calc
```

## Running tests with Windows batch

The batch file ```runt.bat``` performs the concatenation and executes the resulting file. For example, to run the 'calc' example provided in this repo, run ```runt.bat``` as follows:

```shell
runt calc-check calc
```
## Writing your own test
There are four rexx functions to call in your test script:
* context()
* globalmock()
* localmock()
* check()

Syntax:                                                                    
  * context('descripttion') is the test suite description                      
  * check() is the check procedure to check returncodes from a function or variables set/changed in a procedure.
    - input to check()   
      - arg1: Description of the test  
      - arg2: procedure call incl. arguments
      - arg3: variable name to check if any
      - arg4: operand like =, <>, >, <, >= or <=
      - arg5: expected value
  * localmock() is the function to call if you want to mock a call and replace it with some other rexx code. Localmock() is reset by the following call to check() and a following call to globalmock()
  * globalmock() is the function to call if you want to mock a call and replace it with some other rexx code. Globalmock() is in effect for the rest of the test suite.
    - input to localmock() and to globalmock()
      - arg1: Name of procedure to mock
      - arg2: Rexx code to replace the procedure call with. Lines must be seperated by ;
  - note: globalmock() resets any localmock() so always use globalmock() before localmock()
  - limitation: the same procedure call cannot first be mocked by globalmock() and then later be remocked by a localmock() - unpredicted result will occure.
  * Samples:
```shell  
globalmock('sayCalcResultWithReturn', "say 'call to sayCalcResultWithReturn mocked #1'; say 'call to sayCalcResultWithReturn mocked #2';")
localmock('sayCalcResult', "say 'call to sayCalcResult mocked #1'; say 'call to sayCalcResult mocked #2'; say 'call to sayCalcResult mocked #3';")
check( 'Adding 5 and 2', "calc(5,  '+', 2)",, 'to be', 7)
check( 'Dividing 15 by 3 = 5', "calcWithoutAnyReturn 15, '/', 3", 'calcResult', '=', 5)
```

## Running tests with JCL

On a zOS system, concatenate the files and run the resulting Rexx program using any mechanism you prefer. For example, you could use ```IKJEFT01``` to run a test script. The JCL might look something like this (from http://documentation.microfocus.com/help/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.microfocus.eclipse.infocenter.enterpriseserver.net%2FGUID-64EB1C60-F89C-4C9F-9D55-03B15A2AAB60.html):

```
//REXXTSO JOB 'IKJEFT01 REXX',CLASS=A,MSGCLASS=A
//* 
//CREATE    EXEC  PGM=IEBGENER 
//SYSIN     DD  DUMMY 
//SYSPRINT  DD  SYSOUT=A,HOLD=YES 
//SYSUT2    DD  DSN=&TEMPREX(REXTSO),DISP=(,PASS), 
// SPACE=(CYL,(1,1,1)),UNIT=3390, 
// DCB=(LRECL=80,RECFM=FB,DSORG=PO) 
//SYSUT1    DD  DSN=[t1 file],DISP=SHR
            DD  DSN=[test script file],DISP=SHR
            DD  DSN=[t2 file],DISP=SHR
            DD  DSN=[file to be tested],DISP=SHR
            DD  DSN=[t3 file],DISP=SHR
//RUN       EXEC PGM=IKJEFT01,PARM='REXTSO' 
//SYSEXEC   DD DSN=&TEMPREX,DISP=(SHR,PASS) 
//SYSTSPRT  DD SYSOUT=A,HOLD=YES 
//SYSTSIN   DD DUMMY
//

## Change history
* 0.0.1 initial version by Dave Nicolette
* 0.0.2 (not tested on z/OS nor Windows)
  - Variable initialization moved to init-procedure in t3.rexx
  - t1, t2 and t3 renamed to .rexx to trigger indent, coloring etc in VScode
  - check() function expanded to handle both calls to functions and procedures
  - check() function expanded to compare named varables instead of only return values
  - check() function expanded also to handle =, <, >, <>, ^= >= and <=
  - call to expect() funktion moved from test script to check() function in t3.rexx
  - a lot more samples added.
* 0.0.3 (not tested on z/OS nor Windows)
  - mock() function added
* 0.0.4 (not tested on z/OS nor Windows)
  - mock() function renamed to localmock()
  - globalmock() added
  - result from program with mocks collected and printed at the end of the run
